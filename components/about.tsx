      <p>
        Longtweet is an{' '}
        <a href="https://github.com/ricokahler/longtweet.io">open-source</a>,
        ad‑free, tracker‑free, free‑to‑use blog service that integrates with
        Twitter.
      </p>
      <p>That's right. No ads. No trackers. As simple as that.</p>
      <p>Longtweet is not affiliated with Twitter in any way.</p>
      <h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
      <p>
        There have been other sites like this one that have empowered others to
        share important messages with their audiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's clear to me that sites like these are valuable and needed —
        especially in times we live in today.
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference here is that this site is determined to be highly
        performant and ad-free through simplicity and efficient architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        That way your message can reach as many people as possible while not
        being cluttered by any noise.
